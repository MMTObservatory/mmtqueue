**2018-04-03:**  Starting a README.md in this directory.  All of the astroplan 0.3 code has been included (and modified) within this directory so the separate astroplan dependency has been removed.  Other dependencies include: astropy 3.0+, numpy 1.14+, pytz, redis, and requests.  Also, it helps to have the Intel Math Kernel Libraries (mkl) installed.  This library decreases the compute time by about 25%.

In this version of the code, I'm not using the multicore processing option.  Daily sunset and sunrise times are computed only once and stored in a global "daily_events" structure that is updated, as needed, by constraints.  This greatly decreases computing time since sunrise/sunset had been computed for each observing block in the MeridianConstraint.  Now it's only computed once for each day.  Similarly, meridian transit times for targets are cached in daily_events.  This helps in calculations for the beginning, middle, and end of observing blocks with the meridian transit calculated only once.  With these optimizations, multicore processing is of limited benefit.
